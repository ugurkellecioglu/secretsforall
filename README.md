This project is a 100 percent safe social platform where people share their secrets anonymously with strangers. I made this project without any profit, to improve myself in the field of react. Thanks to this project, I used typescript. I preferred mongodb as database. Instead of including global state management systems such as redux within the application, I used the context api of react and got help from props. I used React's built-in hooks and made performance improvements with hooks like useMemo, useCallback.
