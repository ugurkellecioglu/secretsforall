      "I consider myself a mentally strong individual, with a good sense of justice and a very strong morality. And yet everyday it eats at me because I wonder if this is just an unconscious act of rebellion against those better off with me and that I would throw everyone I know under the bus if in return I was offered a ticket to the elite class.It's not that I know for certain I would, but just that I legitimately do not know because I have never know anything more than my situation. I have never been an elite. I just see all the tyrants of the world constantly popping into power and wonder if they too had been good people with a good vision at some point or another.I live in constant misery wondering if everything and everyone I think I care about is just a result of my situation.Am I breakable?"
